 Problem 2:

 Background:
 Bangalore has heavy traffic. One common cause is slow-moving vehicles using the same lanes as fast-moving vehicles.
 Auto rickshaws form a majority of these slow-moving vehicles.

 Problem statement:
 The Indian government traffic jam analysis department has done some research and has found that traffic jams will occur
 when the number of auto rickshaws on the road is more than 40. Unless it is after 8pm in which case there are no
 traffic jams because the daytime traffic has finished.

 Examples:

 Given there are 30 auto rickshaws on the road
 And the time is before 8pm
 When I check to see if there is a traffic jam.
 Then no traffic jam is predicted

 Given there are 41 auto rickshaws on the road
 And the time is before 8pm
 When I check to see if there is a traffic jam.
 Then a traffic jam is predicted

 Given there are 60 auto rickshaws on the road
 And the time is after 8pm
 When I check to see if there is a traffic jam.
 Then no traffic jam is predicted

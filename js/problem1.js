 Problem 1

 Background:
 India has a kite flying/fighting tradition. Each kite is tied to a thread that has ground glass rubbed onto it. This means one kite can cut another kite's thread, leaving the losing kite drifting down for someone to catch. When a kite fight starts, everyone shouts "Peche!", and when a kite wins, they shout "Ipo kaate!"

 Problem statement:
 We will assume that every 3rd kite that flies will end up starting a kite fight, every 5th kite ends up losing a kite fight. So print the numbers from 1 to 100; but for multiples of 3, print "Peche!" instead of the number; and for multiples of 5, print "Ipo kaate!"; and for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Peche! Ipo kaate!"

 Examples:
 Given there are 100 kites
 When the game begins
 Then the output should be
 1 2 Peche! 4 Ipo kaate! Peche! 7 8
 ...and so on
